Description: Centralized Trace management using sys.settrace.
        
        We allow several trace hooks to get registered and unregistered and
        allow tracing to be turned on and off temporarily without losing the
        trace hooks. You can also indicate filters on events for which trace
        hooks should fire and mark methods that should automatically be
        ignored.
