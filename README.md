- The user interface has been adapted from [pandastable](https://github.com/dmnfarrell/pandastable) by [Damien Farrell](https://github.com/dmnfarrell). 

- The mobile application was developed by through MIT's App inventor II.

- This program is going to be released with the GPLv3 license when it is ready for testing.

- We'll release an "alpha" version for testing soon.
