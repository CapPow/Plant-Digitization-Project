- This is a collaboration project designed and developed by UTC students.

- This code is intended to be used in tandom with a mobile collection app currently in beta testing for Android.

- The mobile was developed through MIT's App inventor II.

- This program is going to be released with the GPLv3 license when it is ready for testing.

- We'll release an "alpha" version for testing soon. 
 
- Source code will be kept here.

- The wiki will eventually contain all necessary documentation needed by a user to install/use the application.
