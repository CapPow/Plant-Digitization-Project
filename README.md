- sample data contains what it says
- kraldesk is a virtual environment from my computer
	- since I'm programming on Ubuntu, for now create your own Python virtual environment and use the codeishere folder
- in /codeishere/ folder, you'll find the pandastable source we're modifying and kraldesk.py application
	- to run the application:
		- install pandastable in your virtualenvironment
		- "python3 setup.py install" ---- the setup.py file should be in /pandastable/ folder
		- then run with "python3 kraldesk.py" in a command prompt

- csv View 
    - contains the code for selecting and displaying a basic csv data. 
    - It also has the processing functions added in.

- kralNotePostProcessing 
    - contains initial code for api interaction functions. It presumes the user has already added a new field "scientificName".
    - This code should be adaptable to the final GUI on a by function basis

This program is going to be released with the GPLv3 license when it is ready for testing.

We'll release an "alpha" version for testing soon.
Source code will be kept here.
The wiki will eventually contain all necessary documentation needed by a user to install/use the application.
