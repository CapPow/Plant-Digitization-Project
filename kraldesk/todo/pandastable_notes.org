#+TITLE: notes on PD Project

* DONE break the address into parts that work with the darwin core
* DONE google api call reduction have attribute for table that is a list of dictionaries (unique key for each locality string)
** DONE just add dictionaries to a list
** DONE search the list with the current gps coordinate values in the same fashion as the dictionary name
* DONE address parts need to be added to corresponding row values
** DONE try adding these rows to the test csv (match Darwin Core)
** DONE reverse locality string to broadest to most narrow
** DONE add corresponding values to the appropriate cells
*** DONE add part of the list/dict that relate to column header
*** DONE reduce rounding of GPS coordinates to 5 decimal places
*** DONE talk to Caleb about missing street name or street number in api return (around line 3325)
**** just use the street name (get rid of path column inserts)
***** if that's empty return an empty string
***** add address to the locality string but don't create an individual column for it
***** TODO use short name for country
**** popup error is at line 3343
*** DONE talk to Caleb about column header differences (should we adapt the function for capitalization)
**** look at line 3403
**** yes setup to compare to lowercase value from columnName()
* TODO add function for the catalogue of life api call (in Caleb's scripts on Github)
** TODO parse XML correctly so we get correct Scientific Name each time
*** we want the result that has name_status='*synonym' ; accepted_name (accepted sci-name) ; name_html (authorship)
also though, we could pull the updated scientific name from the name_html section, potentially use only one xml element

** TODO have popup ask user if they want to update the sci-name with what was returned from SERNEC
** TODO add associated taxa in genScientificName function
** TODO where should I place results from sci name, authorship, and associated taxonomy?
* TODO turn both into a function for a Toolbar button
** TODO find out how to create picture for button
** TODO setup a function for button to call all functions and do auto run; instead of individual buttons
* TODO Miscellaneous
** TODO saving should default to current open file
** TODO cleanup toolbar and popupmenu (in all cases for popupmenu, in reference to click location / event object)
*** TODO toolbar cleanup
*** TODO should ensure all basic functionality exists in toolbar (i.e you can do all you need to with toolbar)
*** TODO popupmenu should be cleaned up with only necessities existing in menus for each object
** TODO towards end start cleaning up code
*** ALWAYS REINSTALL THE MODULE AFTER DELETING CODE TO ENSURE CHANGES DON'T BREAK OTHER THINGS
*** TODO remove unecessary files first
*** TODO remove unecessary functions/classes second
*** TODO remove unecessary variables and comments last
** TODO must add license text and author(s) to each of the source files
** TODO build an installer for windows
** TODO build a snap for Linux (if time permits, otherwise just distribute code/binary)

* saved errors
** error in getRecName call

* Issues
** No GPS coordinates for site (ask user for site location)
*** ask for locality and address components for one site (cascade data to records of same site)
** scientific name should be editable (or ask with old/updated name)
*** every row that has a specimen number should have a scientific names (site would not)
*** specimen level data should always have a sci-name
** preference menu for user name (identified by, often same as collector)
*** preference menu could be related to a config file that stores changes
